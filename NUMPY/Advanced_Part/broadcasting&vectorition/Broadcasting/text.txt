how numpy  hamdle arrays of different shape  ? 




Broadcasting Rule - 3

1- Matching dimensions - agar 2 arrays same shape ke hote hai tb elements vise  operation normally ho jayega 
eg- [1,2,3] + [4,5,6] = [5,7,9]


2- Expending single elements - 
eg -  [1,2,3] + 10 = [11,12,13]

3- Incompatable shapes-  
eg- [1,2,3] + [1,2] =   Error show krega
