Introduction  to programming 

computer is a  binary language understand.

what is programming?
--> programming is the process of writing instruction.
real eg. ->  one robot and work is  foods cooked  writing a recipie 

what is compiler ?
--> its high level code convert in machine code .(Entire all code its one time convert in machine code )
lang- c,c++,java

what is interpretor?
-->its high level code convert line by line in   machine code .
lang- python,javascript 

python its also used interpretor and helps debugger .

bugs -->  error

debugs --> its means find  errors  & removed  this process called.


high level(HLL) -> 1. Easy to read & write
              2. its nature is slow 
              3. eg.- java,c,c++,python 
              4. high level language its need translate 


Low level (LLL)-> 1. directly hardware  interact 
             2. its nature is Fast And Dificulty 
             3.Eg.- Assembly,machine-code 
             4.LLM is harder 

python - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability.
         It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.
         its used Web-devlopment ,data-science,data-analysis,aiml ,automation

Syntax - 
          

features -  1. Easy to Learn.
            2. python is interpreted language.(help debugging process easily)
            3. cross plateform(by using mac,linux,windows)
            4. Huge library support(python built in library using data science ,ai  do work )
            5. Open Source 
            6. Python  is object programming language and functional programming also 
            7. python is scalable and fast
