object oriented programming 

type	                             Definition	                                                      Real-life Example	                 Key Concept
Encapsulation	    Hiding internal details using private variables and methods	     Bank Account (Balance access restricted)	      Data Protection
Abstraction	        Hiding unnecessary details and showing only essential ones	     ATM Machine (User sees UI, not internal logic)   Interface Design
Inheritance	        One class inherits properties from another class	             Car and Bike (Both are Vehicles)	              Code Reusability
Polymorphism	    One interface, multiple implementations	                          Animals (Different sounds for Dog and Cat)	Flexibility and Extensibility



Before oops  -
using procedural programing language to write a code (structured programing)
by using function 
and step by step execute 



problems 
1- code duplication 
2-  code maintanance
3-  data security issues  
4-  poor code Reusability
5-  No real world representation 


solve this problem and generate oops 

oop - object oriented programing (represend real world thing is an object )


            object 

    data           functions (methods,behaviour)


oops ke 5 concept 
1- classes & objects 
2- Inheritance
3- Encapsulation
4- Abstraction
5- Polymorphism
