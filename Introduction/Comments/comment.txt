 What is a Comment in Python?
➤ Comments are lines in code that Python ignores during execution. 
They are used to explain or annotate the code for better understanding.
 
 ✅ Single-line comment:
 # This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints text


✅ Multi-line comment:

'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans several lines.
